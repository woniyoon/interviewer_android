# Interviewer 
a interviewer app in Android

## Introduction
- This was an individual project from the school created in October 2017. It needs some improvements, but it means a lot to me since it's the first mobile app I created in my life.

## Things I used
- __Android Studio__ for the frontend side
- __Eclipse__ for the backend side
- __MySQL__ for storing all the information including user info, history, and questions & answers
- __Design__ Patterns such as Builder Pattern and Singleton Pattern
- __EventBus__ / __SharedPreferences__ / __REST api__ / __RecyclerView__ / __Fragments__ and __Activities__ 

## How it looks like ?

- You can start a test by choosing the topic from radio buttons and tapping on start button. Plus you need to tap on 'Result' button in order to finish the test and see the result. The questions you'll see are not relevant to the topic you chose though...

- All of your results will be stored in DB, means you can check your own history, too! 


## After The Project
- It was challenging, but interesting that I made my own application from scratch. I'd made some projects in Java before, but they just print things on console.
  I suffered a lot to see errors, but I was so excited to see something visually on the device. 
- I always headed to my classmates to get some help, I couldn't have been satisfied with the result without their help. I'm grateful that I could learn things from them.
- There is only one thing I regret : I didn't know how to use gitHub and couldn't fill out my tracker on gitHub...
